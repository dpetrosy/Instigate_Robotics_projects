## 📜 About Repository

Here are 3 small projects that I've done during a programming course for the beginner at Instigate Robotics.
* 3d model developed in FreeCAD at our choice
* KTurtle programming tasks
* Develop a game in Scratch at our choice

## 🛠️ FreeCAD

The task was to develop a 3d model in FreeCAD. So I choose something interesting for me and made 3d model for \
[120mm M829 Armor-Piercing, Fin-Stabilized, Discarding Sabot (APFSDS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M829). \
I used [these references](FreeCAD/Reference) during the development. \
To see the 3D model download the [FreeCAD software](https://www.freecad.org/downloads.php) and open the **.FCStd** file.

## 🐢 KTurtle

There were 3 tasks, which needed to develop in KTurtle:

* Write a pseudocode to draw any polygon.
* Write a pseudocode to draw a circle.
* Write a pseudocode to draw a 3d cube, which depends on viewpoint.

KTurtle documentation is located [here](KTurtle/Documentation). \
To run the sources download the [KTurtle learning environment](https://apps.kde.org/kturtle/) and open the **.turtle** files.

## 👨🏻‍💻 Scratch

The task was to develop a 2d game in Scratch of our choice. \
So I made a reaction game, to see it just open **.sb3** file in [Scratch website](https://scratch.mit.edu/).
